# Save me, Sims!

üì¢ This project was conducted as part of the 2024 Winter Semester Deep Learning Society in Korea University [AIKU](https://github.com/AIKU-Official) activities.

## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to redecorate your home or a specific space in a completely different style but found it too troublesome to move furniture or make purchases?

We propose a service that allows you to redesign and visualize your space exactly how you want, simply by providing a short video clip taken from different angles and some prompts describing your requirements.

## Methodology
<p align="center"><img width="700" src="https://github.com/MooGeunPark/3DGS-Indoor_Interior/blob/main/images/Pipeline.png"></p>   

1. Record a short video capturing the space from various angles.
2. Input your prompt describing the desired changes. Example: ‚ÄúReplace the table with the one I provided. Put a plate on the table.‚Äù
3. se a GAN-based AI to modify the images according to the prompt.
4. Use a 3D reconstruction model for rendering and visualization.

## Example Output

## Limitations & Future Works
### Limitations
* Due to GPU memory issues, we were unable to experiment with many models.
* Since we were unable to fine-tune the model, there is a resolution gap compared to diffusion models, which limits performance.

### Future Works
* We focus on running models that do not require extensive computing resources or adjust the resolution for testing.
* Set the task in more detail and focus on just one specific objective.
